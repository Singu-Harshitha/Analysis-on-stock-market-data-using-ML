REGRESSION PROJECT-
-OBJECTIVE:‚ÄúTo predict global stock market performance using Machine Learning and identify the best model for forecasting PortfolioOpen.‚Äù
üîπ Project Overview
Applied Machine Learning to predict global stock market performance

Target variable: PortfolioOpen

Compared multiple regression models
Features: 17 | Target: PortfolioOpen
Sources: global stock exchanges, forex rates, bond yields, crypto prices.

*Preprocessing steps:
-Missing values handled (median imputation)
-Outliers treated (IQR method)
-Dropped irrelevant columns
-Converted categorical to numeric

*EDA Insights
-PortfolioOpen strongly correlates with PreviousPortfolioClose (~0.98).
-BTCINR moves opposite to bond yields.
-USDINR & GBPINR highly correlated (~0.79).
-Gold has little influence on portfolio changes.

*APPLIED DIFFERENT ML MODELS
-Best Model: Random Forest Regressor
-R¬≤ Score: 0.9541 (80:20 split)
-Ensemble methods (XGBoost, Gradient Boosting) also performed strongly.
-Simpler models (KNN, SVR) gave weaker results.

*DEEP ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED WITH THE HELP OF NEURAL NETWORK
*CONCLUSIONS WERE DRAWN-the best accuracy holds the value~0.9209 which occured in neural networks 
*THE BEST ACCURACY HOLDS FOR THE VALUE ~0.9209 WHICH OCCURED IN NEURAL NETWORKS
